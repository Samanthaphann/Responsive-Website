                       Alcatraz opened on August 11, 1934. The Federal Government decided to open 
                       it to show the public that they were serious about the rampant crime happening
                       in the 20s and 30s. They picked the location because the rough currents and high 
                       temperatures would make it difficult to escape.

                    <h1> When did it close?</h1>
                    <p> Alcatraz closed on March 21, 1963 after operating for 29 years. It closed due 
                        to it being too expensive to operate. It costed $10 per prisoner per day in Alcatraz.
                        That's 3 times more as much as running other federal prisons at that time.

                        escaped Alcatraz. They escaped by making paper mache replicas of their heads. 
                        What happened to still remains unknown and a mystery.
